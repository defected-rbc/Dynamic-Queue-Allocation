Long and unorganized queues in high-traffic areas such as shopping malls and hospitals lead to increased wait times and minimized service efficiency, eventually reducing customer satisfaction and efficiency for providers. Addressing these challenges, this research proposes a machine learning (ML) model for dynamic queue allocation, designed to optimize queue management and minimize wait times. Utilizing the XGBoost algorithm, the model predicts queue lengths and determines optimal counter allocations at different times throughout the day. By predicting peak queue periods and modifying counter assignments accordingly, the model dynamically adapts to real-time demand, therefore enhancing the efficiency and user experience.
The research results show that this dynamic allocation approach notably reduces average wait times compared to traditional and static queue management methods, benefiting both customers and service providers. This research promotes the field of queue management by providing a practical solution for real-time optimization in various queueing environments. Lengthy and chaotic lines in busy places like shopping malls and hospitals lead to longer wait times and less effective services, which eventually lowers provider efficiency and consumer satisfaction. In reciprocation to these problems, this research suggests a machine learning (ML) model for dynamic queue allocation which aims to reduce wait times and improve queue allocation. The ML trained approximates queue lengths and calculates the best counter to be allocated at various times of the day using the XGBoost algorithm. The perspective automatically adjusts to real-time demand by predicting peak queue periods and modifying counter assignments accordingly, improving queueing systems' usability and efficiency.
